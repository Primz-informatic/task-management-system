A collaborative task management application built with vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating software engineering principles and team development practices.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Task Management: Create, edit, delete, and organize tasks
* 👥 Multi-User Support: User management and authentication
* 📊 Analytics: Task statistics and progress tracking
* 🧪 Testing: Comprehensive test suite with Jest
* 🔄 Version Control: Git workflow with feature branches

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js 14+ installed
* Git installed and configured
* Modern web browser

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Primz-informatic task-management-system.git
cd task-management-system

# 2. Install dependencies

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project demonstrates key software engineering principles:

* **MVC Pattern**: Separation of Model, View, and Controller
* **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
* **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling between components
* **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test coverage
* **Version Control**: Git workflow with feature branches
